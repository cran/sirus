Description: A regression and classification algorithm based on random forests, which takes the form of a short list of rules. SIRUS combines the simplicity of decision trees with a predictivity close to random forests. The core aggregation principle of random forests is kept, but instead of aggregating predictions, SIRUS aggregates the forest structure: the most frequent nodes of the forest are selected to form a stable rule ensemble model. The algorithm is fully described in the following articles: Benard C., Biau G., da Veiga S., Scornet E. (2019) <arXiv:1908.06852> for classification, and Benard C., Biau G., da Veiga S., Scornet E. (2020) <arXiv:2004.14841> for regression. This R package is a fork from the project ranger (<https://github.com/imbs-hl/ranger>).
